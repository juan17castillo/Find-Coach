# Find-Coach
In this project I will test everything I learned during my Vue course applying the composition of the API, Http requests via an emulated backend Firebase realtime server, Router, Vuex, token management, authentication among others. This web App consists of the search for coaches with software skills with whom you can contact, or be one of the platform.
